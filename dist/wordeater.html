          Wordeater is a literary magazine at Joliet Junior College. Authors and artists are able to submit their work to be reviewed and published in this magazine. It features stories, poems, and paintings. It started out as just a small magazine that would be printed once a semester. In 2004 the owners decided to build a site so students can see their work also published online. The first site was made with SharePoint Designer and the process to update was very bulky and involved being on campus to FTP to the server. I was tasked with streamlining this process for them. This was one of my first projects at JJC. I decided to create a WordPress site for them. That way it can be updated from anywhere with an internet connection. This also gave them the ability to add in comment sections to each published submission in the future. I set up each published student's work as a blog post so that was possible, and to make the update process simple and quick. It is a custom child theme I tweaked.

            Unfortunately the college decided to take the site down in 2018 due to lack of ownership. I archived the site and have it saved in case this project is brought back to life.
