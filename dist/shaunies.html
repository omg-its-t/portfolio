          This is the first iteration of Shaunie's Resort. Prior to this there was no web presence or branding. It is built upon Lodgify CMS for booking and scheduling. The user can scroll through a slideshow on the landing page and is presented with a general set of images from all around the property. Each cabin has its own detail modal that contains its own slideshow of images giving the user a chance to decide if they would like to rent that cabin. Upon the checkout process the user is then presented with the options to add on "extras." These can be pontoon rentals, pets, boats and boat motors. The CMS has options to take payments and automatically schedule the user to the calendar, currently that is not implemented yet. I created emails for the owner and admins, and set up automated emails as reminders and thank you's. All photos were taken and edited by me.

          <p>
            I am planning on working with the owner to implement payments for the 2019 season. I would also like to edit the CSS to make the whole site better size down for mobile devices. Some screen resolutions are not the best due to the CMS, further mobile friendly CSS will need to be added.
