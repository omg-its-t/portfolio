            The public user input form can be seen at <a href="http://jjc.edu/grundy-workforce-job-board-services">http://jjc.edu/grundy-workforce-job-board-services</a>. This is where all the data is gathered about each job posting. Once the form is submitted it triggers an email with a link to edit the form data; this email is sent to the owners of the form. The owners then have a chance to make any edits to the form if needed, once complete they can approve it. The form data then gets displayed into a Drupal 8 view with various filters to slim down the data to fit across one page. There is also a link to another view with all the job posting details. This view uses the Drupal  8 <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_flipped_table">Views Flipped Table Module</a> to allow the rows and columns to be flipped so the data will display horizontally. For the user the view is low maintenance, once the 'post until' date passes, the listing is automatically removed. I also customized the CSS to fit the JJC theme.

          <p>
              I don't have much planned for the future as far as functionality. The users/owners of this are extremely happy with how it has been working for them. However, I would like to work on the CSS for a cleaner display. I also would like to eliminate using a table at all if possible, on a mobile display.
