          <p>
            I am Theo Mellske, Web Developer, Designer, SharePoint Administrator, and always learning something new. My official title is Web Developer at Joliet Junior College, but I dabble in all the aforementioned activities. My role is unique because it gives me the chance to wear many different hats. My team and I recently guided the institution though a complete website redesign going from .NET to a Drupal site. I enjoy finding new ways to do old things, or sometimes old ways to do new things. There is always a new skill to learn or perfect, that is why I find this world so interesting. If I am not by my computer I am in a driver seat, or under a hood. Cars are my next passion - they are just like your code; you build it, break it, fix it, and repeat.

            <!-- TODO jazz this up its really boring -->
              Currently using on the job: HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, PHP, SQL Server Management Studio, SharePoint, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I am in the process of sharpening my PHP to build custom Drupal modules.<br />
              In my free time I like to play around with Node, SASS, and WordPress theme development.

            My role at JJC is unique and presents many opportunities to work with a wide array of technologies. I get to work with Drupal, SharePoint, Javascript, and C# to name a few. I also administer the intranet, which runs SharePoint 2013. The best part of the job is getting to work with everyone across the college finding out what their needs are and adapting my knowledge and skills to formulate a solution to better their day to day operations.

            I started off going back to college to get my Associate's Degree, but along the way I found my love for all things Internet. When I graduated in 2016 I applied for the open position as Web Developer, nailed the interview and now I am an employee.

            Before my breakout into the IT world I was an avid bicycle mechanic. I love working with my hands and fixing anything that is broken. While employed here I worked in the shop assembling new bicycles, tuning up old ones, and diagnosing every issue imaginable with customer's bikes.
